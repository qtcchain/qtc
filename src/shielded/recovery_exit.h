// RECOVERY_EXIT — transparent-claim stranded-note recovery (post-125,000).
// See doc/history/recovery_exit_125000_spec.md.
//
// SAFE ROUTE (per audit): consensus does NOT trust a claimant-supplied nullifier. It DERIVES the exact
// normal-path nullifier from the revealed NOTE itself — `ComputeSmileNullifierFromNote(SMILE_GLOBAL_SEED,
// note)`, the same deterministic note->SMILE2 derivation the post-sunset `V2_SEND` unshield uses — and
// ATOMICALLY retires BOTH the commitment and that nullifier into the SHARED nullifier set. Because the
// derived nullifier is byte-for-byte the one a normal `V2_SEND` spend of this note would reveal, a note
// spent on EITHER path collides in the shared set — closing cross-path AND pre-sunset-spent double-spends.
//
// Crucially, the SMILE2 nullifier is a function of the note alone (no private key), so the claim does NOT
// reveal any spend key — ownership is proven by a PQ signature under the note's pubkey. No sibling-note
// exposure. This module implements the pure derivation + constraint logic; DB retirement, bundle encoding,
// prover, membership proof, and PQ ownership-signature verification are the integration layer (see spec).
