/**
 * Shielded-pool unshield (z->t egress) velocity cap — v0.32.0 defense-in-depth.
 *
 * Sits ALONGSIDE the turnstile (ShieldedPoolBalance, the net-supply firewall) and the C-002 per-tx
 * value/serial bindings (soundness). Those make forgery non-constructible and bound total loss; this
 * bounds the RATE at which value can leave the pool, so a stolen spend key or a future inner-proof
 * regression becomes a slow, observable leak rather than an instant drain.
 *
 * Rule: over any trailing window of `window_blocks` blocks, the total net unshield value must not
 * exceed `cap_bps`/10000 of the shielded pool balance. Implemented as a window SUM over a per-block
 * net-egress log -- a pure function of recent egress, so it is trivially reorg-safe (Undo erases the
 * one entry the connect added) and, because the log is persisted, pruning-safe and identical on every
 * node. Deterministic: height, egress, pool, and params are the only inputs (no wall-clock, no I/O).
 *
 * `net_egress` for a block is the block's net value leaving the pool: max(0, sum of value_balance),
 * where value_balance>0 means value left the pool (an unshield) -- so shields in the same block offset
 * unshields. Inert before the activation height (callers gate on it); self-serve unshield does not
 * exist before C-002 anyway.
