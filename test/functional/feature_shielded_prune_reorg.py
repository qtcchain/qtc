"""Regression test for issue #35: a pruned node must RECOVER from a reorg whose
disconnected block references a shielded anchor below the prune horizon, instead
of entering the unrecoverable restart-loop.

Issue #35 background
--------------------
On a pruned node (``-prune=N``) a reorg can disconnect a block that carries a
shielded bundle whose merkle anchor lives in a block file that has already been
pruned. ``DisconnectBlock()`` then needed to rebuild shielded state by walking
ancestor blocks from disk (``RebuildShieldedState() -> ReadBlock()``); that walk
hits a block below the prune horizon and the read fails with the opaque

    ReadRawBlock: FlatFilePos(nFile=-1, ...)

A persisted in-flight shielded mutation marker would then be left on disk, so on
the *next* restart ``EnsureShieldedStateInitialized()`` unconditionally re-ran the
same rebuild, failed identically with

    RebuildShieldedState: failed to read block <hash>
    ...
    Failed to initialize shielded state database.

and the node crash-looped forever -- deterministic and unrecoverable.

Fixes under test
----------------
  * 63b5b5d0 + eaf36925 -- clear the stale shielded mutation marker, retain the
    persisted shielded state under pruning, and fail-fast (instead of issuing the
    opaque ReadRawBlock error) inside ``DisconnectBlock`` when a prune-unsafe full
    rebuild would be required.
  * Further hardening (this branch) -- the marker-recovery path in
    ``EnsureShieldedStateInitialized()`` now also guards on block availability
    (``ShieldedFullRebuildBlocksAvailable``) and, when blocks are pruned, clears
    the stale marker and keeps the persisted shielded snapshot rather than
    crash-looping.

POST-FIX expectation (asserted below)
-------------------------------------
After the reorg disconnects the affected shielded block on a pruned node and the
node is restarted, the node comes back UP and is RPC-responsive, and the debug
log shows the graceful recovery path:

  * DisconnectBlock refuses the prune-unsafe rebuild:
        "Refusing the prune-unsafe rebuild"
    (only emitted when DisconnectBlock has to fall back to a disk rebuild), AND/OR
  * the restart marker-recovery path:
        "clearing the stale marker and retaining persisted"
  * the node never logs the crash signature:
        "ReadRawBlock: FlatFilePos(nFile=-1"
        "RebuildShieldedState: failed to read block"
        "Failed to initialize shielded state database."

PRE-FIX expectation (documented, NOT asserted -- it cannot occur on a fixed
binary): the node would crash on the reorg with "ReadRawBlock: FlatFilePos(
nFile=-1)" and then, on every restart, loop on "RebuildShieldedState: failed to
read block" / "Failed to initialize shielded state database." and never finish
startup.
