# QTC Fast-Start Validating Nodes

This directory contains the first-run bootstrap wrapper for operators who want
to:

1. fetch the latest matching snapshot for a chain,
2. load it with `loadtxoutset`,
3. keep an eye on background validation with `getchainstates`.

The scripts are intentionally small and composable. They do not try to invent a
canonical snapshot distribution system for QTC. Instead, they support either:

- a direct `--snapshot-url` plus `--snapshot-sha256`, or
- a JSON manifest that maps each chain name to the published snapshot metadata, or
- the compact per-release `snapshot.manifest.json` emitted by
  `contrib/devtools/generate_assumeutxo.py`.

For release installs, use the latest snapshot bundle published with the same
QTC release as the binary. The compact manifest records `snapshot_file_version`
for troubleshooting; the wrapper and `loadtxoutset` read the snapshot file
directly and do not require operators to choose a snapshot format manually.

Entry points

- `qtc-agent-setup.py` installs the right published binary archive for the
  current platform from a GitHub release bundle and can immediately hand off to
  the fast-start bootstrap flow.
- `miner-faststart.sh` starts the bootstrap flow with the miner-oriented preset.
- `service-faststart.sh` starts the bootstrap flow with the service-oriented preset.
- `qtc-faststart.py` is the shared orchestrator and can be called directly.

Current support matrix

- `main`: supported with compiled assumeutxo metadata and published release snapshots
- `regtest`: supported for default-consensus dev/test flows
- `testnet`, `testnet4`, `signet`: unsupported for fast-start until `src/kernel/chainparams.cpp` gains real assumeutxo entries for those chains

For a detailed from-scratch mining-node procedure using generic `/var/qtc/`
paths, see [QTC Mining Node Snapshot Runbook](../../doc/qtc-mining-node-snapshot-runbook.md).

Presets

- `miner` keeps the node in a compact, mining-friendly state:
  `prune=4096`, `blockfilterindex=1`, `coinstatsindex=1`,
  `retainshieldedcommitmentindex=1`, and conservative outbound-peer floors for
  mining.
- `service` keeps the node in a service-oriented state:
  `prune=0`, `txindex=1`, `blockfilterindex=1`, `coinstatsindex=1`, and
  `retainshieldedcommitmentindex=1`.

QTC now treats retained shielded commitment indexing as the normal
operator-facing posture because it keeps restart and snapshot recovery fast for
wallet, mining, and service users. The fast-start presets still write
`retainshieldedcommitmentindex=1` explicitly so the generated config remains
clear and portable; use `retainshieldedcommitmentindex=0` only if you
intentionally want the slower externalized path.

The recommended miner fast-start config shape is:

```ini
server=1
listen=1
rpcbind=127.0.0.1
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
dnsseed=1
fixedseeds=1
addnode=node.qtc.dev:19335
addnode=node.qtcchain.org:19335
addnode=node.qtc.tools:19335
prune=4096
blockfilterindex=1
coinstatsindex=1
# keep shielded commitment index on disk (faster restart; default).
retainshieldedcommitmentindex=1
# chain guard reports mining risk and self-heals peers; it does not stop work.
miningchainguard=1
miningminoutboundpeers=0
miningminsyncedoutboundpeers=0
miningmaxheaderlag=8
```

Use DNS names rather than hard-coded peer IP addresses in configs and runbooks.
Peer IPs can change or disappear; DNS bootstrap names can be updated without
requiring every miner to edit local config. Use all three public bootstrap DNS
names so honest miners converge on the same peer fabric quickly. Avoid
`connect=`-only production mining topologies because they bypass normal peer
diversity and can increase stale block risk. Mining-chain guard keeps honest
miners working through fork-risk warnings, IBD, network-disabled, no-tip, and
local-behind-peer-median states. Those states are reported through mining RPCs
and trigger peer recovery where possible instead of turning unattended miners
off.

For horizontally scaled service gateways, add
`--matmul-service-challenge-file=/shared/path/matmul_service_challenges.dat`
so every issuer/redeemer node points at the same shared challenge registry.

The wrapper writes its generated config and downloaded snapshot under
`<datadir>/faststart/`, so the workflow is isolated from an operator's existing
`qtc.conf`.

By default `qtc-agent-setup.py` keeps its download cache in a sibling
`<install-dir>-agent-setup-cache` directory so the extracted install tree stays
clean. Pass `--cache-dir` if you want that cache somewhere else.

Published release bundles should also include `qtc-release-manifest.json`.
That manifest advertises `platform_assets`, which map the release archives for
Linux/macOS/Windows to stable platform ids such as `linux-x86_64` and
`macos-arm64`. Linux CUDA release archives use the explicit ids
`linux-x86_64-cuda12` and `linux-x86_64-cuda13`; see
[`doc/linux-release-builds.md`](../../doc/linux-release-builds.md) for the
hardware and driver matrix. `qtc-agent-setup.py` consumes that manifest so
binary users can install the right archive without hard-coding filenames. For
remote release URLs, the installer now treats `SHA256SUMS` as the source of
truth for the manifest, archive, and snapshot-manifest hashes, and it verifies
`SHA256SUMS.asc` when the release advertises one. Use
`--allow-unsigned-release` only for intentionally unsigned test bundles.
If the GitHub repository or release is private, export `QTC_GITHUB_TOKEN`,
`GITHUB_TOKEN`, or `GH_TOKEN` before running the installer so it can
authenticate the manifest and archive downloads through the GitHub release
asset API. `qtc-faststart.py` honors the same env vars for private snapshot
manifest and snapshot asset URLs.
The canonical platform archives also now include the helper scripts in this
directory, the mining helpers under `contrib/mining/`, and
`doc/qtc-download-and-go.md`, so a direct archive extraction still gives the
operator the documented fast-start entry points without needing a second repo
checkout.
Release bundles may also publish signer-qualified Guix attestation assets under
the manifest's `attestation_assets` list. The installer ignores those
provenance files, but they are part of the intended operator-facing release
contract for reproducible major-architecture builds.

One-shot install + bootstrap

```bash
python3 contrib/faststart/qtc-agent-setup.py \
  --repo qtcchain/qtc \
  --release-tag v0.33.0 \
  --preset service \
  --datadir="$HOME/.qtc-service"
```

That flow:

1. downloads `qtc-release-manifest.json`,
2. verifies the manifest against `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS.asc` for remote releases,
3. selects the matching binary archive for the current platform,
4. verifies the archive and `snapshot.manifest.json`,
5. extracts `qtcd` / `qtc-cli` plus the bundled helper scripts/docs,
6. runs `qtc-faststart.py` with the chosen preset.

Machine-readable install summary

`qtc-agent-setup.py --json` now keeps bootstrap chatter on stderr and prints a
clean JSON summary to stdout. That makes it safe for agentic installers to
capture the installed binary paths and the generated fast-start config before
handing off to mining or service automation:

```bash
SETUP_JSON="$(python3 contrib/faststart/qtc-agent-setup.py \
  --repo qtcchain/qtc \
  --release-tag v0.33.0 \
  --preset miner \
  --datadir="$HOME/.qtc" \
  --json)"

QTC_CLI="$(printf '%s' "$SETUP_JSON" | jq -r '.qtc_cli')"
QTCD="$(printf '%s' "$SETUP_JSON" | jq -r '.qtcd')"
FASTSTART_CONF="$(printf '%s' "$SETUP_JSON" | jq -r '.faststart_conf')"

contrib/mining/start-live-mining.sh \
  --datadir="$HOME/.qtc" \
  --conf="$FASTSTART_CONF" \
  --chain=main \
  --cli="$QTC_CLI" \
  --daemon="$QTCD" \
  --wallet=miner \
  --should-mine-command='/usr/local/bin/qtc-should-mine-now'
```

When `--preset miner` is used, the JSON summary also includes
`start_live_mining_command` and `stop_live_mining_command` arrays for direct
handoff into unattended mining supervisors.

Manifest shape

The preferred per-release manifest emitted by
`contrib/devtools/generate_assumeutxo.py` includes the snapshot height, base
block hash, file version, and checksum:

```json
{
  "chain": "main",
  "height": 123456,
  "blockhash": "...",
  "snapshot_file_version": 7,
  "snapshot_sha256": "...",
  "asset_url": "https://.../snapshot.dat"
}
```

The wrapper also accepts a chain-mapped manifest:

```json
{
  "main": {
    "url": "https://.../main-snapshot.dat",
    "sha256": "..."
  },
  "regtest": {
    "url": "https://.../regtest-snapshot.dat",
    "sha256": "..."
  }
}
```

You can keep a local copy as `contrib/faststart/snapshot-manifest.json`, or
pass `--snapshot-manifest=/path/to/manifest.json` or
`--snapshot-url=https://...` directly. If those URLs point at a private GitHub
release, `qtc-faststart.py` also honors `QTC_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, or
`GH_TOKEN` for the manifest and snapshot asset downloads.

A manifest entry by itself is not enough for public test chains. `loadtxoutset`
will still reject snapshots for `testnet`, `testnet4`, or `signet` until the
corresponding serialized hash and block metadata are compiled into
`src/kernel/chainparams.cpp`.

Example

```bash
contrib/faststart/miner-faststart.sh \
  --datadir="$HOME/.qtc" \
  --chain=main \
  --snapshot-manifest="$HOME/qtc-snapshot-manifest.json"
```

The wrapper will stop only after `loadtxoutset` succeeds and the chainstate
poller sees the snapshot chain disappear, unless `--follow` is set. If the
daemon reaches a better active chainstate before `loadtxoutset` runs, the
wrapper now treats the snapshot as superseded and continues instead of failing.
Daemon-side RPC connection overrides such as `--daemon-arg=-rpcport=...` are
also mirrored into the wrapper's internal `qtc-cli` calls automatically.
The snapshot base block must be known in the local header chain before
`loadtxoutset` can activate it; the wrapper waits for headers using the
manifest block hash and does not require the full base block to be downloaded.

Service-gateway example with a shared redeem registry:

```bash
contrib/faststart/service-faststart.sh \
  --datadir="$HOME/.qtc-service-a" \
  --chain=main \
  --snapshot-manifest="$HOME/qtc-snapshot-manifest.json" \
  --matmul-service-challenge-file=/srv/qtc-shared/matmul_service_challenges.dat
```

Adaptive service-challenge example:

```bash
qtc-cli listmatmulservicechallengeprofiles 0.25 0.75 0.25 6 1 adaptive_window 24 4 35
qtc-cli getmatmulservicechallengeprofile balanced 0.25 0.75 0.25 6 1 adaptive_window 24 4 35
qtc-cli getmatmulservicechallengeplan solves_per_hour 600 0.25 0.75 adaptive_window 24 0.25 6 4 35

```

Real admission control should still use `redeemmatmulserviceproof`; the local
`solvematmulservicechallenge` RPC is mainly for integration testing and
agent-controlled clients. The profile-based issuance path is the recommended
operator default because it maps directly onto the built-in `easy`, `normal`,
`hard`, and `idle` tiers, returns average-node pacing estimates, and now
includes operator-capacity guidance for planning how much challenge volume a
node can sustain during idle-time or service-gateway workloads.
`getmatmulservicechallengeplan` adds the inverse planner for “I need N
solves/hour with this worker budget”; it returns the direct issuance defaults
plus the closest built-in profile matches for the current network state.

For agentic clients that do solve locally, `solvematmulservicechallenge` now
accepts optional `time_budget_ms` and `solver_threads` arguments so a client
can cap how long or how wide the local solver runs in the background.
High-volume verification services can keep proof checking stateless by passing
`false` as the final argument to `verifymatmulserviceproof` or
`verifymatmulserviceproofs`, which skips the local/shared issued-challenge
registry lookup and omits the local issuance/redeem fields from the result.

Operators can watch `getdifficultyhealth` for
`service_challenge_registry.status`, `healthy`, `path`, and `quarantine_path`.
If a shared registry file is unreadable or on an unsupported version, the node
now quarantines that file instead of silently reusing it.

For the miner preset, `contrib/mining/start-live-mining.sh` now understands the
fast-start-generated `--conf`, `--chain`, and custom `--rpcport` settings, and
it auto-provisions the named mining wallet plus an address file when you do not
pass `--address` / `--address-file`. The mining helpers now also support
`--help`, which is useful when an installed binary bundle is being driven by an
agent instead of a hand-maintained shell profile. Auto-provisioned mining
wallets are added to the node's load-on-startup list so supervised daemon
restarts keep mining working, and the launcher now fails early if the
background loop dies before its initial startup check completes.
