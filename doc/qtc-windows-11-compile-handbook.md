# QTC Windows 11 Compile Handbook

This handbook is the step-by-step Windows 11 path for people who want to
build QTC from source for the first time.

It is written for a normal Windows 11 x64 machine and aims to get you from:

- no local QTC build

to:

- a working `qtcd.exe`
- a working `qtc-cli.exe`
- a clean first node start
- a clear path toward wallet setup and mining

If you already know the QTC build flow and only want the shorter technical
version, see [build-windows-msvc.md](./build-windows-msvc.md).

## Precompiled Archive on This Branch

If you only want a generic precompiled Windows x64 CLI archive from this
branch, use:

- `contrib\prebuilt\windows\qtc-29.4.0-generic-win64-x86_64-w64-mingw32.zip`
- `contrib\prebuilt\windows\qtc-29.4.0-generic-win64-x86_64-w64-mingw32.zip.sha256`

## What This Handbook Recommends

For most public Windows users, the best path is:

1. install the required Windows tools
2. clone the repository
3. run the QTC PowerShell wrapper
4. let it build a headless wallet-enabled node
5. verify the binaries
6. start the node
7. create a wallet
8. wait for sync
9. begin mining only after the node is healthy and near tip

This handbook intentionally does **not** start with CUDA. First get the normal
Windows build working. Then add CUDA later if you want to experiment with the
experimental backend.

## Before You Start

### Supported target

- Windows 11 x64

### Recommended machine state

- at least `20-30 GB` free for source, build artifacts, and dependency caches
- much more free space if you plan to keep a full QTC node data directory
- a short source path with no spaces is best

Recommended clone path:

```text
C:\src\qtc-node
```

Avoid very long or space-heavy paths if you can.

## Step 1: Install the Required Software

You need:

- Git for Windows
- Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools or Visual Studio 2022 Community
  - with `Desktop development with C++`
- CMake

Recommended:

- Python 3.11

Optional:

- NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit
- Nsight Compute

### One-command `winget` installs

Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
winget install --id Git.Git --exact --source winget
winget install --id Kitware.CMake --exact --source winget
winget install --id Python.Python.3.11 --exact --source winget
winget install --id Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools --exact --source winget `
  --override "--quiet --wait --norestart --nocache --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools --includeRecommended"
```

Optional CUDA tools:

```powershell
winget install --id Nvidia.CUDA --exact --source winget
winget install --id Nvidia.Nsight.Compute --exact --source winget
```

## Step 2: Download the QTC Source Code

Choose a short path and clone the repository:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/qtcchain/qtc-node.git C:\src\qtc-node
Set-Location C:\src\qtc-node
```

If you already cloned the repo somewhere else, just change into that folder:

```powershell
Set-Location C:\path\to\qtc-node
```

## Step 3: Run the Windows Build Wrapper

QTC includes a PowerShell wrapper that captures the Windows lessons we learned
from a real Windows 11 build.

Run:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\contrib\devtools\build-qtc-windows.ps1 `
  -InstallDependencies
```

### What this wrapper does

It will:

- verify Git, CMake, and Visual Studio C++ tools
- install missing pieces with `winget` when asked
- create a standalone `vcpkg` checkout under `C:\qtc-deps\vcpkg`
- keep `vcpkg` state on short paths to reduce Windows path-length failures
- configure a wallet-enabled headless QTC build
- build the main node binaries
- run a regtest smoke test so you know the result is actually usable

### Why this is the recommended path

The older upstream-style Windows notes were inherited from Bitcoin Core and do
not match the public QTC build path well enough on their own. This wrapper is
the QTC-specific path.

## Step 4: Confirm the Build Output

With the default settings, the output goes under:

```text
.\build-windows-msvc\bin\Release\
```

The most important files are:

```text
.\build-windows-msvc\bin\Release\qtcd.exe
.\build-windows-msvc\bin\Release\qtc-cli.exe
```

If those exist, your core Windows build is in good shape.

## Step 5: Start the Node for the First Time

Create a minimal QTC config at:

```text
%APPDATA%\QTC\qtc.conf
```

Suggested starting config:

```ini
server=1
listen=1
txindex=1
```

Then start the node:

```powershell
Start-Process -FilePath .\build-windows-msvc\bin\Release\qtcd.exe
```

## Step 6: Check That the Node Is Alive

Use the CLI to talk to the node:

```powershell
.\build-windows-msvc\bin\Release\qtc-cli.exe getblockchaininfo
.\build-windows-msvc\bin\Release\qtc-cli.exe getnetworkinfo
.\build-windows-msvc\bin\Release\qtc-cli.exe getmininginfo
```

You want to see:

- the RPC responding normally
- peers connecting
- blocks and headers progressing over time

## Step 7: Create a Wallet

Create a wallet for mining rewards or normal usage:

```powershell
.\build-windows-msvc\bin\Release\qtc-cli.exe createwallet miningwallet
.\build-windows-msvc\bin\Release\qtc-cli.exe -rpcwallet=miningwallet getnewaddress
```

That new address is where mining rewards can be sent later.

## Step 8: Back Up the Wallet

Back it up after creation, funding, or encryption:

```powershell
.\build-windows-msvc\bin\Release\qtc-cli.exe -rpcwallet=miningwallet backupwallet "$HOME\\Desktop\\miningwallet-backup.dat"
```

For long-term safety, also keep copies of wallet metadata and any passphrases in
your own secure storage process.

## Step 9: Wait for Full Sync Before Mining

Do not ignore node health just because the node launches.

On QTC, the node should be:

- out of initial block download
- near tip
- reporting healthy chain-guard status

Check:

```powershell
.\build-windows-msvc\bin\Release\qtc-cli.exe getmininginfo
```

Important fields:

- `initialblockdownload`
- `chain_guard.healthy`
- `chain_guard.reason`
- `chain_guard.recommended_action`
- peer and tip-health related values in `chain_guard`

Current nodes keep serving mining work while those fields warn, so unattended
miners do not take nonce rate off the network. Use the fields for alerts and
peer remediation rather than as an automatic stop condition.

## Step 10: Start a Basic Solo-Mining Loop

For large-scale production mining, the correct path is still
`getblocktemplate` plus external workers.

If you want a simple local solo-mining loop from Windows PowerShell, you can
use:

```powershell
$Cli = Resolve-Path .\build-windows-msvc\bin\Release\qtc-cli.exe
$Address = (& $Cli -rpcwallet=miningwallet getnewaddress).Trim()

while ($true) {
    $info = & $Cli getmininginfo | ConvertFrom-Json
    if ($info.chain_guard.healthy -eq $false) {
        Write-Host ("chain guard warning: {0} action={1}" -f `
            $info.chain_guard.reason, $info.chain_guard.recommended_action)
    } else {
        Write-Host "chain guard healthy"
    }
    & $Cli -rpcwallet=miningwallet generatetoaddress 1 $Address | Out-Null
}
```

That loop keeps mining and uses chain-guard output for operator visibility.

## Optional: Add Benchmarks or Tests to the Build

### Build with benchmark targets

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\contrib\devtools\build-qtc-windows.ps1 `
  -InstallDependencies `
  -BuildBench
```

### Build with test targets

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\contrib\devtools\build-qtc-windows.ps1 `
  -InstallDependencies `
  -BuildTests
```

## Optional: Enable the Experimental CUDA Backend

Only do this after the normal Windows build works.

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\contrib\devtools\build-qtc-windows.ps1 `
  -InstallDependencies `
  -InstallCudaToolkit `
  -EnableCudaExperimental `
  -BuildBench
```

Then inspect the backend:

```powershell
.\build-windows-msvc\bin\Release\qtc-matmul-backend-info.exe --backend cuda
```

This is optional and experimental. The public Windows build story should start
with the plain CPU-backed path first.

## Troubleshooting

### The build fails in `vcpkg`

Use the wrapper defaults. They are intentionally short:

- `C:\qtc-deps\vcpkg`
- `C:\qtc-deps\vcpkg_installed\qtc-node`
- `C:\qtc-deps\vcpkg-buildtrees`

These paths are there to reduce the most common Windows path-length problems.

### My repo path contains spaces

The wrapper helps, but a short path like `C:\src\qtc-node` is still the best
choice.

### `qtcd.exe` starts but mining does not

Check `getmininginfo` first. Most of the time the node is still syncing or the
chain guard is intentionally pausing mining.

### I want the GUI

Start with the default headless build. Only add `-BuildGui` once the headless
path is already working.

### I want CUDA

Get the normal Windows build working first. Then add CUDA later.

## The Short Version

If you want the minimum reliable public Windows flow, it is this:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/qtcchain/qtc-node.git C:\src\qtc-node
Set-Location C:\src\qtc-node
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\contrib\devtools\build-qtc-windows.ps1 -InstallDependencies
Start-Process -FilePath .\build-windows-msvc\bin\Release\qtcd.exe
.\build-windows-msvc\bin\Release\qtc-cli.exe createwallet miningwallet
```

Then wait for sync, verify `getmininginfo`, and only mine when the node is
ready.
