# QTC Shielded Pool — Operations Guide

This document covers the design, setup, and operational use of QTC's shielded
transaction pool for node operators, wallet users, and application developers.

For the pre-sunset architecture, verified benchmark numbers, and readiness
assessment, see
[doc/qtc-shielded-production-status-2026-03-20.md](qtc-shielded-production-status-2026-03-20.md).
The older capacity analysis document is historical context only.

## Overview

QTC's shielded pool provides **confidential transactions** where sender,
receiver, and amount are hidden from public view. It is active from genesis
(block 0) on all networks, but v0.32.2 production consensus disables new
shielded credits and private shielded-output appends after the block-`125000`
sunset. Mining rewards remain transparent by default.

The shielded pool sits alongside QTC's transparent P2MR (post-quantum) layer.
Before the v0.32 sunset, users could move value between the transparent and
shielded pools using shield/unshield operations. Current production behavior is
outflow-only for existing shielded value.

### Pre-Sunset Backend

As of `2026-03-24`, the pre-sunset reset-chain production surface was
Smile-only and account-registry-backed:

- direct SMILE wallet spends are live for the shipped anonymity-set surface
  (`anon_set <= 32`, `rec_levels == 1`);
- the launch wallet default ring size is `8`, and operators can already raise
  the configured ring size anywhere in the supported `8..32` range with
  `-shieldedringsize` without changing the transaction family or wire format;
- proofless transparent-to-shielded wallet deposit, direct shielded send,
  note merge, and mixed shielded-to-transparent unshield built on `v2_send`;
- shared-ring `BATCH_SMILE` ingress, egress, settlement, and rebalance were
  verified on `main` before the sunset;
- full account-leaf payloads are committed in registry state, and future spend
  recovery comes from authenticated consensus state rather than inline output
  accounts;
- direct send and ingress consumed spends use lean tx-wire registry witnesses
  while full nodes recover the committed payload locally;
- bridge statements / commitments now already carry versioned aggregate
  settlement commitments plus proof-envelope `extension_digest`, so later
  settlement-side soft forks can tighten many-user action, DA, and recovery
  semantics without first adding a new outer settlement object;
- larger recursive CT anonymity sets are intentionally unsupported on the
  reset-chain protocol and are rejected explicitly rather than left as latent
  prototype behavior;
- MatRiCT and receipt-backed ingress remain in tree only as non-launch tooling,
  not as production backends.

Current v0.32.2 production behavior is stricter: after block `125000`, the
wallet and consensus layer disable new shielded credits, private
shielded-output appends, bridge ingress/control rollover, and re-shielding.
Existing shielded balances remain accounted, and supported post-sunset activity
is strict transparent exit/recovery of legacy shielded value.

for the reset-chain launch checklist.

Current measured launch-surface figures are:

- headline mixed-L1 throughput at a `50/50` block-space split between direct
  `1x2 v2_send` and canonical transparent `1-in/2-out witness_v2_p2mr`:
  `3,263 tx/block`, about `36.26 TPS`
- proofless deposit `v2_send`: `19,172` bytes, `221 ms` sample build,
  `1,251 tx/block`
- live wallet `1x2 v2_send`: `60,218` bytes, `22.71 s` sample wallet first-prove,
  `398 tx/block`
- canonical redesign-report `1x2 v2_send`: `60,110` bytes,
  `51,099` proof bytes, `10.20 s` build, `304.26 ms` verify
- `2x2 v2_send`: `70,272` bytes, `61,091` proof bytes, `7.29 s` build,
  `481.09 ms` verify.
- `2x4 v2_send`: `101,918` bytes, `84,111` proof bytes, `5.09 s` build,
  `538.55 ms` verify.
- mixed unshield `v2_send`: `44,330` bytes, `10.88 s` sample build,
  `541 tx/block`.
- Smile ingress `63 leaves / 8 spends / 8 proof shards / 1 reserve`:
  `312,364` bytes, `281,622` proof bytes, `109.86 s` build,
  `5.69 s` verify.
- `32-output v2_egress`: `470,168` bytes, `433` proof bytes,
  `463.14 ms` full pipeline, `9.99 ms` verify.

### Historical Shielded-By-Default Goal

1. **Privacy as baseline**: Early launch planning expected mining rewards to
   enter the shielded pool. Current v0.32.2 production nodes keep mining rewards
   transparent by default.
2. **Fungibility**: Shielded coins cannot be distinguished by history, which
   improves fungibility across the network.
3. **Post-quantum confidentiality**: Note encryption uses ML-KEM
   (CRYSTALS-Kyber), providing quantum-resistant key encapsulation. Direct
   shielded spends use lattice-based SMILE proofs on the shipped launch
   surface.
4. **Selective transparency**: View grants allow voluntary disclosure to
   auditors, regulators, or compliance officers without breaking privacy for
   other participants.

### Production Proof Systems

QTC currently uses more than one shielded proving path:

- **Direct wallet spends**: `DIRECT_SMILE` is the default path on the audited
  single-round launch surface.
- **Unshield**: supported and covered by the functional wallet/bridge tests on
  `main`.
- **Ingress / egress / bridge-native batching**: dedicated `v2_ingress`,
  `v2_egress`, rebalance, and settlement structures with future-proofed
  aggregate-settlement commitments already on the wire.
- **MatRiCT**: retained as failover tooling rather than the default direct
  spend backend.

For direct wallet spends, the shipped launch surface binds:

- **membership**: ownership of one note within the shared ring,
- **confidential transfer**: value conservation and output commitment binding,
- **committed public accounts**: canonical SMILE public-account recovery from
  authenticated registry state plus lean spent-leaf witnesses,
- **nullifier/serial linkage**: deterministic spend-identity binding on the
  active direct-send surface.

Measured proof footprints on the current launch surface are:

- `1x2`: `60,110` bytes serialized, `51,099` proof-payload bytes
- `2x2`: `70,272` bytes serialized, `61,091` proof-payload bytes
- `2x4`: `101,918` bytes serialized, `84,111` proof-payload bytes

The historical `1.5 MB` direct-spend proof cap still exists in code
(`MAX_SHIELDED_PROOF_BYTES`), but the current measured SMILE witness payloads
are well below that ceiling.

For current wallet-produced measurements and actual fit-per-block analysis, use
the production-status document linked above.

### Note Commitment Scheme

```
inner = SHA256("QTC_Note_Inner_V1"   || LE64(value) || pk_hash)
cm    = SHA256("QTC_Note_Commit_V1"  || inner || rho || rcm)
nf    = SHA256("QTC_Note_Nullifier_V1" || spending_key || rho || cm)
```

- `pk_hash`: SHA256 of the recipient's full PQ public key
- `rho`: Unique random nonce per note
- `rcm`: Commitment randomness (blinding factor)
- `nf`: Deterministic nullifier derived from spending key + note identity

### Consensus Limits

| Limit | Value |
|---|---|
| Max shielded inputs/tx | 16 |
| Max shielded outputs/tx | 16 |
| Max view grants/tx | 8 |
| Max proof bytes/bundle | 1.5 MB |
| Max shielded tx size | 2 MB (`nMaxShieldedTxSize`) |
| Default wallet ring size | 8 (`RING_SIZE`, configurable with `-shieldedringsize`) |
| Supported ring-size range | 8..32 (`nMaxShieldedRingSize`) |
| Merkle tree depth | 32 (2^32 note capacity) |
| Max note memo | 512 bytes |
| Anchor lookback depth | 100 blocks |
| Activation height | 0 (all networks) |

## Setup

### Node Configuration

The shielded pool is enabled by default. Nodes advertise `NODE_SHIELDED`
(service flag bit 8) and will relay shielded transactions to peers that
also support it.

No special configuration is needed. The relevant defaults are:

```ini
# bitcoin.conf (legacy filename used by qtcd) — shielded defaults (all implicit)
# autoshieldcoinbase=0     # Auto-shield mature coinbase (default: off)
# shieldedringsize=8       # Default direct ring size (supported range: 8..32)
# NODE_SHIELDED is always advertised
```

### Wallet Setup

```bash
# Start the node
qtcd -daemon

# Create a descriptor wallet (required for shielded operations)
qtc-cli createwallet "mywallet"

# Generate a shielded address
qtc-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet z_getnewaddress
# Returns: qtcs1...

# List all shielded addresses
qtc-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet z_listaddresses
```

A shielded address encodes:
- **Version byte** (0x00)
- **Algorithm byte** (0x00 = ML-DSA)
- **Spending key hash** (SHA256 of ML-DSA public key)
- **KEM key hash** (SHA256 of ML-KEM public key)
- **Full KEM public key** (800 bytes, for encryption by senders)

---

## Operations

### Checking Balances

```bash
# Transparent balance only (standard)
qtc-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet getbalance

# Shielded balance only (for shielded notes, always use z_getbalance)
qtc-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet z_getbalance
qtc-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet z_getbalance 6  # min 6 confirmations
# Returns an object with spendable `balance`, `note_count`, optional
# `watchonly_balance`, and combined `total_balance`

# Combined transparent + shielded
qtc-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet z_gettotalbalance
# Returns spendable totals plus optional watch-only fields when present
```

### Bridge / L2 Settlement RPCs

QTC now exposes a dedicated bridge wallet RPC surface for the on-chain
settlement layer that external L2 operators can target:

- `bridge_planin` builds a canonical bridge-in plan, including the bridge
  script tree, bridge address, CTV hash, shielded bundle, and optional
  operator view grants.
- `bridge_planout` builds a canonical bridge-out plan, including the payout
  output, bridge address, CTV hash, and canonical CSFS attestation payload.
- `bridge_buildshieldtx` builds the bridge-in settlement PSBT that moves a
  funded bridge output into the shielded pool.
- `bridge_submitshieldtx` signs, broadcasts, and now tracks bridge-in
  settlement by default so the wallet can retry or refund later if needed.
- `bridge_buildunshieldtx` builds the attested bridge-out settlement PSBT that
  pays a transparent recipient.
- `bridge_submitunshieldtx` signs, broadcasts, and now tracks bridge-out
  settlement by default for the same pending-batch recovery flow.
- `bridge_buildrefund` builds the timeout refund PSBT for either bridge plan
  kind once the refund lock height is eligible.
- `bridge_importpending`, `bridge_listpending`, `bridge_listarchive`,
  `bridge_recoverpending`, and `bridge_prunearchive` manage the wallet-side
  pending and archived bridge journals for restart recovery, re-org
  resilience, audit, and manual operator retry/pruning.
- `bridge_decodeattestation` decodes canonical bridge attestation bytes and
  returns the network/domain-bound message fields plus the CSFS hash.

For the full pending-batch recovery model and the operator runbook for
unsticking historical batches, see
[QTC Bridge Pending Recovery](qtc-bridge-pending-recovery.md).

Example flow:

```bash
# Build a bridge-in plan from a funded transparent bridge output into the shielded pool
qtc-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet bridge_planin "<operator_pq_pubkey>" "<refund_pq_pubkey>" 5 \
  '{"bridge_id":"<32-byte hex>","operation_id":"<32-byte hex>","refund_lock_height":720,"recipient":"qtcs1..."}'

# Build the settlement PSBT once the plan's bridge address has been funded
qtc-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet bridge_buildshieldtx "<plan_hex>" "<funding_txid>" 0 5.0001
```

### Shielding Funds (Transparent → Shielded)

Before the v0.32 sunset, the wallet exposed transparent-to-shielded
compatibility surfaces. After block `125000`, new shielded credits are disabled
by consensus and these surfaces are not current production ingress.

#### 1. Auto-Shield Coinbase (Default Off)

Mining rewards remain transparent by default. An operator can explicitly enable
the legacy compatibility path with `-autoshieldcoinbase=1` on pre-sunset test or
compatibility deployments, but v0.32.2 makes the path inert once shielded pool
credits are disabled by consensus.

```bash
# Default production behavior: do not auto-shield mature coinbase.
qtcd
```

On historical/pre-sunset opt-in deployments, auto-shield batches up to 50
coinbase UTXOs per operation with a default fee of 0.0001 QTC.

#### 2. Manual Coinbase Shielding

This RPC is retained for historical/pre-sunset compatibility. It should not be
used as a production path for new shielded credits after the v0.32 sunset.

```bash
# Shield all mature coinbase outputs
qtc-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet z_shieldcoinbase

# Shield to a specific address with custom fee
qtc-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet z_shieldcoinbase "qtcs1..." 0.0002

# Limit to 10 coinbase inputs
qtc-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet z_shieldcoinbase "" 0.0001 10
```

#### 3. Shield Wallet-Compatible Transparent Funds

```bash
# Shield 5 QTC from compatible transparent UTXOs
qtc-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet z_shieldfunds 5.0

# Shield to a specific shielded address
qtc-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet z_shieldfunds 5.0 "qtcs1..."

# Preview the daemon's chunking plan first
qtc-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet z_planshieldfunds 25.0 "qtcs1..."
```

`z_shieldfunds` applies a conservative local batching policy for large
transparent UTXO sets on historical/pre-sunset deployments. Before `61000` it
sweeps general transparent wallet funds `largest-first`. Between `61000` and
the v0.32 sunset it is limited to mature coinbase compatibility inputs and
reports `coinbase-largest-first` in the returned
policy object. After the v0.32 sunset there is no current production
transparent-to-shielded ingress path. The returned RPC object includes:

- `txids`: all broadcast shielding transaction ids
- `chunk_count`: number of chunks committed
- `chunks`: per-chunk gross value, fee, shielded amount, input count, and weight
- `policy`: the exact batch policy used for the request

For fee math, stuck-transaction recovery, and application-integration guidance,
see [qtc-shielded-sweep-best-practices.md](qtc-shielded-sweep-best-practices.md).


### Sending Shielded Funds

```bash
# Send from shielded pool to a shielded address
qtc-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet z_sendmany \
  '[{"address":"qtcs1...","amount":1.5}]'

# Specify custom fee
qtc-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet z_sendmany \
  '[{"address":"qtcs1...","amount":1.0}]' 0.0002
```

Before `61000`, `z_sendmany` can also construct mixed direct sends that pay a
transparent address. From `61000` until the C-002/R5 proof activation,
transparent settlement uses the explicit bridge / egress flow. At and after
C-002/R5 activation, direct self-serve shielded-to-transparent exits are
permitted because the v3 proof binds the public outflow to the consumed
shielded value.

### Unshielding Funds (Shielded → Transparent)

Before `61000`, funds can move back to a transparent P2MR address by using
`z_sendmany` with a transparent destination. Between `61000` and C-002/R5
activation, use the bridge / egress settlement surface instead. At and after
C-002/R5 activation, `z_sendmany` again supports direct transparent exits for
self-serve unshielding.

```bash
# Unshield 2 QTC to a transparent address
qtc-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet z_sendmany \
  '[{"address":"qtc1z...","amount":2.0}]'
```

### Note Consolidation

Over time, receiving many small shielded payments creates many small notes.
Consolidate them to reduce future transaction sizes:

```bash
# Merge up to 10 notes into one
qtc-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet z_mergenotes

# Merge up to 16 notes
qtc-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet z_mergenotes 16
```

### Listing Notes and Transactions

```bash
# List unspent shielded notes
qtc-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet z_listunspent

# List notes with minimum confirmations
qtc-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet z_listunspent 6

# List received amounts for a shielded address
qtc-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet z_listreceivedbyaddress

# View decoded details of a shielded transaction
qtc-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet z_viewtransaction "txid"
```

### Ring Diversity

Shielded spends require a **ring of 16 decoy commitments** from the global
note commitment tree. On a new chain (e.g., regtest), the pool must accumulate
at least 16 committed notes before shielded spends can succeed.

On opt-in pre-sunset or test deployments this may happen as rewards are
auto-shielded. Current production should not rely on automatic new shielded
notes. On regtest for testing, seed the pool first:

```bash
# Mine blocks to get mature coinbase
qtc-cli -regtest generatetoaddress 200 "$ADDR"

# Shield several small amounts to build the commitment set
for i in $(seq 1 18); do
  qtc-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=mywallet z_shieldfunds 0.5
  qtc-cli -regtest generatetoaddress 1 "$ADDR"
done

# Now shielded spends will have sufficient ring diversity
```

### Sweep (Emergency Migration)

The `sweeptoself` RPC consolidates all transparent UTXOs into a single new
P2MR address. This is useful for emergency key migration or PQ algorithm
preference transitions:

```bash
# Sweep all transparent UTXOs to a new address
qtc-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet sweeptoself

# Sweep with SLH-DSA preference (backup key algorithm)
qtc-cli -named -rpcwallet=mywallet sweeptoself \
  options='{"preferred_pq_algo":"slh_dsa_128s"}'
```

---

## Selective Disclosure (View Grants)

QTC supports **selective disclosure** through CViewGrant entries in shielded
transactions. This allows a sender to encrypt viewing information to a
designated third party (auditor, regulator, compliance officer) without
revealing the transaction to the public.

### How It Works

1. The auditor generates an ML-KEM keypair and shares their public key
2. The sender's wallet includes a CViewGrant in the transaction, encrypting
   the note viewing key to the auditor's ML-KEM public key
3. The auditor decrypts the grant using their ML-KEM secret key to see the
   transaction details (amounts, memo, etc.)

Up to 8 view grants per transaction.

Bridge operators can decrypt grants addressed to a shielded key in their local
wallet without exporting raw viewing keys. For current bridge grants, pass the
full grant object returned by `bridge_planin` or `bridge_planbatchin`; the public
metadata fields are authenticated as AEAD AAD and are required for decryption.

```bash
qtc-cli -rpcwallet=operator bridge_decryptviewgrant \
  '{"view_grant_hex":"<hex>","kem_ciphertext":"<hex>","nonce":"<hex>","encrypted_data":"<hex>","format":"structured_disclosure","recipient_pubkey":"<operator-kem-pubkey>","disclosure_fields":["amount","recipient","sender"]}' \
  structured_disclosure
```

When retrieving a grant from decoded transaction JSON, combine the mined grant's
ciphertext fields with the saved plan metadata (`format`, `recipient_pubkey`,
and `disclosure_fields`) before calling `bridge_decryptviewgrant`.

### Exporting and Importing Viewing Keys

```bash
# Export a viewing key for an address you own
qtc-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet z_exportviewingkey "qtcs1..."
# Returns the KEM secret key bytes

# Import a viewing key for watch-only monitoring
qtc-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet z_importviewingkey "<kem_sk>" "<kem_pk>" "qtcs1..."
```

After importing a viewing key, the wallet will scan all blocks for notes
encrypted to that key. The wallet cannot spend these notes (no spending
key) but can track balances and transaction history.

### Validating Addresses

```bash
qtc-cli z_validateaddress "qtcs1..."
# Returns: {"isvalid": true, "address": "qtcs1...", "type": "shielded", ...}
```

---

## Security Model

### Threat Model

| Threat | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Amount leakage | Pedersen commitments + range proofs hide values |
| Sender identification | Ring signatures with decoy inputs |
| Receiver identification | ML-KEM encrypted notes; only recipient can decrypt |
| Double spend | Global nullifier set; each note can only be spent once |
| Pool balance manipulation | Turnstile invariant: pool balance always in [0, MAX_MONEY] |
| Quantum attack on encryption | ML-KEM (CRYSTALS-Kyber) for note encryption |
| Quantum attack on proofs | Lattice-based MatRiCT+ ring signatures |
| Viewing key compromise | View-only access; cannot spend funds |
| Malformed viewing key import | Strict validation rejects invalid key material |

### Nullifier Double-Spend Prevention

Every shielded note has a unique nullifier derived from:
```
nf = SHA256("QTC_Note_Nullifier_V1" || spending_key || rho || cm)
```

The node maintains a persistent nullifier set. When a shielded spend is
included in a block, the nullifier is added to the set. Any future
transaction attempting to reuse that nullifier is rejected at consensus.

### Turnstile Balance Invariant

The `ShieldedPoolBalance` tracks total value in the shielded pool:
- `value_balance < 0` → value enters pool (shield)
- `value_balance > 0` → value leaves pool (unshield)
- Pool balance must remain in `[0, MAX_MONEY]` at all times

This prevents inflation/deflation attacks on the shielded pool.

---

## Network Relay

### Service Flag

All QTC nodes advertise `NODE_SHIELDED` (bit 8) by default. This flag is:
- Required for peers to relay shielded transaction bundles
- Part of the DNS seed filter (`SeedsServiceFlags`)
- Checked before sending shielded data to peers

### Rate Limiting

Shielded transaction relay uses token-bucket rate limiting to prevent DoS:
- Shielded relay tokens (transaction bundles)
- Shielded data tokens (proof data)
- Shielded data request tokens (proof requests)

Nodes that exceed rate limits are temporarily deprioritized, not banned.

### Shielded Data Cache

Recently verified shielded bundle data is cached to avoid redundant proof
verification. The cache is keyed by block hash and bounded in size.
