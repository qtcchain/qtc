Linux Release Build Variants
============================

QTC Linux releases publish separate x86_64 archives for CPU-only mining and
CUDA mining. The CUDA archives are prepackaged release builds: users do not need
to install the CUDA Toolkit on the target machine, but they do need a compatible
NVIDIA driver and a supported NVIDIA GPU.

## Release asset matrix

| Platform id | Archive suffix | Build flavor | CUDA runtime |
|---|---|---|---|
| `linux-x86_64` | `x86_64-linux-gnu` | CPU-only | None |
| `linux-x86_64-cuda12` | `x86_64-linux-gnu-cuda12` | CUDA 12 | CUDA 12.9.1 |
| `linux-x86_64-cuda13` | `x86_64-linux-gnu-cuda13` | CUDA 13 | CUDA 13.2.0 |

The CUDA runtime is statically linked into the CUDA archives. The packaged
binaries should not have dynamic `libcudart.so`, `libcuda.so`, `libcublas.so`,
or CUDA `RPATH`/`RUNPATH` entries. The target host still supplies the NVIDIA
driver stack, including `libcuda.so.1`.

`cudaRuntimeGetVersion()` reports the statically linked CUDA runtime line, while
`cudaDriverGetVersion()` reports the installed NVIDIA driver API level. These
values can differ; for example, the CUDA 12 build can report runtime `12.9`
while the installed driver reports CUDA driver API `13.2`.

## Hardware support

| Build flavor | Supported hardware |
|---|---|
| CPU-only | x86_64 Linux hosts supported by the normal release build. No NVIDIA GPU or NVIDIA driver is required. |
| CUDA 12 | NVIDIA GPUs with compute capability 8.0 or newer, when the build contains a matching binary image or usable PTX. The Guix CUDA 12 build currently embeds `sm_80`, `sm_86`, `sm_89`, `sm_90`, `sm_100`, `sm_101`, `sm_103`, `sm_120`, and `sm_121`, plus PTX for `compute_80`, `compute_100`, and `compute_120`. Use this archive for Ampere, Ada, Hopper, and the currently targeted Blackwell families; this includes RTX 4090-class `sm_89` hardware. |
| CUDA 13 | NVIDIA GPUs covered by the CUDA 13 release target set in the Guix build. The Guix CUDA 13 build currently embeds `sm_100`, `sm_103`, `sm_110`, `sm_120`, and `sm_121`, plus PTX for `compute_100` and `compute_120`. This archive is intended for the targeted Blackwell-era GPUs. It does not include Ampere/Ada/Hopper images such as `sm_80`, `sm_86`, `sm_89`, or `sm_90`; use the CUDA 12 archive for those GPUs. |

The QTC CUDA runtime probe rejects devices below compute capability 8.0, but
the embedded CUDA image list is still the final build-time compatibility
boundary. If a GPU is visible but no kernel image is available for it, the CUDA
backend can fail when a mining kernel is launched even if basic device probing
succeeds.

Run these checks on the target host:

```bash
nvidia-smi -L
./bin/qtc-matmul-backend-info --backend cuda
./bin/qtc-matmul-solve-bench --backend cuda --iterations 1 --tries 256
```

The backend-info command confirms driver visibility and the selected device.
The solve benchmark is the stronger smoke test because it launches the CUDA
MatMul kernels from the archive.

## Driver support

| Build flavor | Required target-host driver |
|---|---|
| CPU-only | No NVIDIA driver required. |
| CUDA 12 | NVIDIA Linux x86_64 driver compatible with CUDA 12.x. NVIDIA documents the CUDA 12.x minor-compatibility floor as `>= 525.60.13`; the driver paired with CUDA 12.9 Update 1 is `>= 575.57.08`. Newer drivers are supported by CUDA driver backward compatibility. |
| CUDA 13 | NVIDIA Linux x86_64 driver compatible with CUDA 13.x. NVIDIA documents the CUDA 13.x minor-compatibility floor as `>= 580`; the driver paired with CUDA 13.2 GA is `>= 595.45.04`. If the release is later moved to CUDA 13.2 Update 1, the corresponding toolkit driver floor becomes `>= 595.58.03`. |

The CUDA archives do not package or install an NVIDIA driver. Driver selection
is outside the Guix build and release-asset process; operators must install a
driver that supports their GPU and the selected CUDA runtime line.

## Selecting an archive

Use the CPU archive when the host has no NVIDIA GPU, when the installed driver
cannot be upgraded, or when reproducible CPU-only operation is preferred.

Use the CUDA 12 archive for currently deployed Ampere/Ada/Hopper systems and
for any Blackwell systems that need CUDA 12.9 compatibility. This is the
expected archive for RTX 4090 testing.

Use the CUDA 13 archive for systems that have a CUDA 13-capable driver and one
of the CUDA 13 target architectures listed above.

The fast-start installer can select these platform ids explicitly:

```bash
python3 contrib/faststart/qtc-agent-setup.py --platform linux-x86_64-cuda12 ...
python3 contrib/faststart/qtc-agent-setup.py --platform linux-x86_64-cuda13 ...
```
